# Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction
#### Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or customers, typically in a subscriptionbased business model or other service industries. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to retain their customers and maintain revenue. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical data.

 ## Objective
 #### Build a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn.
 #### Understand the factors influencing churn to help businesses take preventive measures.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Development
6. Model Evaluation
7. Deployment and Recommendations

### Key attributes in the dataset:
 Customer Information: Customer ID, age, gender, etc.
 Subscription Details:  Multiple Lines, Internet Service, Online Security, Online Backup  etc.
 Service Usage: Monthly Charges, Total Charges etc.
 Churn Status: Indicates whether the customer churned or not (target variable).

### Step 1: Data Collection
 Import libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
 Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
 Inspect data using `df.info()`, `df.describe()`, and `df.head()`.

 ### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
 Handle Missing Values: Use imputation methods for missing data.
 Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, correct inconsistencies.
 Encoding: Convert categorical data into numerical values using onehot encoding or label encoding.
 Scaling: Standardize numerical features using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.

 ### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 Visualize churn distribution using bar plots or pie charts.
 Analyze correlations between features using a heatmap.
 Identify key factors influencing churn:
   Tenure vs. churn.
   Monthly charges vs. churn.

### Step 4: Feature Engineering
 Create new features like average monthly spend or lifetime value.
 Drop irrelevant features that do not contribute to the model.
 Split the data into features (X) and target variable (y).

 ### Step 5: Model Development
 Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 8020 split).
 Choose algorithms for classification:
   Logistic Regression
   Decision Trees
   Random Forest
   Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

 Train and evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1score, and ROCAUC.

### Step 6: Model Evaluation
 Compare models based on evaluation metrics.
 Use crossvalidation to check the model's stability.
 Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for optimal performance.

 ### Step 7: Deployment and Recommendations
  Deploy the model using Flask, FastAPI, or a cloud service (AWS, Azure, GCP).
  Integrate the model into the business's CRM to provide realtime predictions.
  Suggest strategies based on insights:
  Offer discounts to customers likely to churn.
  Improve customer engagement for highrisk segments.

## Outcome
 By implementing this project, businesses can:
 Proactively reduce customer churn.
 Identify factors contributing to customer dissatisfaction.
 Enhance customer retention strategies.

## Conclusion
 Predicting customer churn is a critical aspect of modern data driven business strategies. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict churn and highlights actionable insights that businesses can leverage to improve customer loyalty and reduce revenue loss.
